# Bamazon

## Introduction

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront which will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.
 

## How Does It Work?
  
  
Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. This will include the ids, names, prices of products for sale and the stock quantity.

The app will then prompt users with two messages.

* The first will ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
* The second message will ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

Once the customer has placed the order, the application will check if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

If not, the app will log a phrase like Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through.
